### Update Time
-- 2023-11-19 We release the code to github.

### Method

![framework](fig/method.png)

### Installation

```
conda create -n cclnet python=3.9
conda activate cclnet
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
conda install tqdm
conda install scikit-learn

pip install yacs
pip install timm
pip install scikit-image
pip install ftfy
pip install easydict
pip install regex
pip install faiss-gpu
```

### Prepare Dataset

- (1) RegDB Dataset [5]: The RegDB dataset can be downloaded from this [website](http://dm.dongguk.edu/link.html) by submitting a copyright form.

    - (Named: "Dongguk Body-based Person Recognition Database (DBPerson-Recog-DB1)" on their website). 
  
- (2) SYSU-MM01 Dataset [6]: The SYSU-MM01 dataset can be downloaded from this [website](http://isee.sysu.edu.cn/project/RGBIRReID.htm).

   - run `python data/process.py` to pepare the dataset, the training data will be stored in ".npy" format.

### Training

For example, if you want to run CCLNet for the SYSU-MM01, you need to train a model to get pseudo_labels for later CLIP training.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_prepare.py
```
This will get a model(without L_it2ce) and two modal pseudo_lables(two '.npy' format files in you DataSet dir).

Later you have to train again, so you need to ensure that the dataset folder contains the pseudo-label file generated in the previous step, or you can download the [pseudo_labels](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ysl8tHZ1ZmKlFXnuJHWBZJ9Giel0Q6nZ?usp=drive_link) we trained into '/SYSU-MM01/pseudo_labels/train_xx_resized_pseudo_label.npy'. You have to run:
```
mkdir /dataset/SYSU-MM01/pseudo_labels/
download '.npy' into /dataset/SYSU-MM01/pseudo_labels/

# training
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_clip.py 
```

### Evaluation

For example, if you want to test CCLNet for SYSU-MM01, you have to run:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py --resume_path 'checkpoints/model_best.pth'
```
